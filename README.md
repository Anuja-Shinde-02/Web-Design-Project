Purpose of the project::

GrubBites, a website for food ordering,was developed to enhance the user experience. The likelihood that a consumer will finish their order rises when the ordering process is simple. Customers have more time to browse the menu, increasing the volume of transactions. Large orders can be placed more easily and customers have more control over their orders.

Using one simple platform, GrubBites enables customers to locate and order their preferred items from a restaurant or food seller. Additionally, GrubBites also provides customers who use their site to place meal orders with exclusive offers and discounts.

Overall, GrubBites' objective is to make it simple for people to purchase food from restaurants and enjoy it.

GrubBites The online food ordering platform GrubBites was created using React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It offers users to place online meal orders for a range of dishes from a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Mexican, Chinese, and more. While the admin interface enables the company owner to control their menu, establish pricing, and monitor order fulfillment for all the many food options offered, customers can follow the status of their orders and receive real-time updates on the status of their deliveries.
